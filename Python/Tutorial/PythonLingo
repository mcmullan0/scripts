Python lingo:
Variables, are a stored numerical constant
String, is a variable that contains text
Operator, tells python what to do +, -, def...
def, define your own fucntion:
	def functionName(bits, of_information, passed from, the main program, to function):
		within the function I now manipulate these bits of information.
Turples lists and dictionarries
	Tuples have (Mark, Angela)
	lists have [Mark, Angela].  Add a value with lstName.append(), to add to the end,
		delete with del cats[#]
	dictionaries have {'Mark':07828978834, 'Angela':0784848484, }, add to the dictionary
		with phonebook['Gingerbread Man'] = 1234567
The difference between these is that Turples are fixed and cannot be edited. Lists can be
edited but can only be referred to by number and with dictionaries you can use a name to refer
to the stored variable.  Delete using del phonebook['Andrew Parson']
